# Deflationary Token

## Overview
Deflationary Token is a smart contract designed for a token that implements a burning mechanism. Every time the token is transferred, a percentage of the total supply is burned, reducing its overall supply over time. This feature aims to create scarcity and potentially increase the token's value. Additionally, the contract includes functions for buying and selling tokens on a native platform.

## Features
- **Burn Mechanism**: Automatically burns a percentage of tokens on every transfer.
- **Buy/Sell Functionality**: Users can buy and sell tokens directly on the platform.
- **Easy Integration**: Designed for seamless integration into existing decentralized applications.

## Smart Contract Functions
- **transfer()**: Allows users to transfer tokens while automatically burning a specified percentage.
- **buy()**: Enables users to purchase tokens.
- **sell()**: Allows users to sell their tokens.
